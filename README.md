# Andrew's Layoff Checklist
*An open-source repository of advice for navigating layoffs*

# Background
When the entire Business Productivity org was eliminated at LinkedIn, I found myself laid off for the first time. It was a chaotic time, and documentation was outdated or flat-out incorrect.

In a peculiar twist of fate, I returned to LinkedIn on the Data Engineering team, only for Eng to get hit with a massive layoff a few months later. This time, I was spared, and many of my colleagues who were impacted reached out for advice. I quickly put together a checklist of actionable info based on my experience, everything from clarifying severance and getting access credentials for tax forms to tips on maintaining your health and building an “ABZ” plan for what you’d like to do next.

This is a living repository of useful info to help people navigate layoffs. It includes the original layoff checklist, and more can be added to lend support in turbulent times.

# How to Contribute
Ideas will be considered that are
* Specific: your contribution addresses a tailored gap or need that does not already exist in the repository
* Actionable: your contribution adds something that laid-off people or jobseekers can follow through with
* Uplifting: the goal of the repository is to help
* Comprehensive: if you have an idea you want to work on, great! But 
* Edits: you don't need to make a massive new document or application to contribute. If you see something specific to improve or enhance in existing materials, that's also good.

If that fits your contribution, create a branch and push a PR. I will review periodically, and if this ever becomes more popular than I can handle, I'll figure out a more comprehensive process then.

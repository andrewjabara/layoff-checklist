Layoffs suck.

Layoffs are [ineffective at reducing costs or improving long-term company performance](https://news.stanford.edu/2022/12/05/explains-recent-tech-layoffs-worried/). 

But layoffs continue to occur. 

If you’ve been affected by a “reduction in force”, I hope this little layoff checklist can help you out. Read through, make some plans, and find those next great opportunities in your life, wherever life may take you.

# Checklist
- [ ] Pause, take a deep breath, go do a little something that brings you joy
- [ ] Clarify the terms of the layoff
  - [ ] Official termination/separation date (particularly important for H1B visa holders)
  - [ ] Severance agreement (this is super important, because the company will generally offer you something in exchange for not suing/badmouthing the company. E.g. 10 weeks pay, front-loaded target commission at 100% quota, early bonus payout, 6 months of COBRA health insurance premium coverage)
  - [ ] If you have belongings in the office, when/how you can retrieve them
  - [ ] Final paycheck date
- [ ] Download anything you’re entitled to that you want to save
  - [ ] Paystubs
  - [ ] Performance reviews
  - [ ] Personal files you’ve stored on your company computer
- [ ] Update password access to ADP/other site for W2 and 1099 forms (so you can get these forms next year for taxes)
- [ ] Save phone numbers for HR/Payroll/Security for future reference
- [ ] Check your benefits
  - [ ] Health insurance coverage (including COBRA)
  - [ ] Spend your FSA if you have one, and if you get prescribed medicine, ask your doctor about switching to 90 day prescriptions so you can frontload a refill
  - [ ] Stock vesting (any accelerated vesting, if you get rehired in another position at the company before official termination date do you get to keep your vests?)
  - [ ] 401k (can it stay, do you need/want to rollover?)
  - [ ] Any employee perks you should use before official layoff date? (yearly small purchase budget, wifi reimbursement, discounted product purchases)
  - [ ] Do you get to keep your computer/monitor/other company equipment?
  - [ ] Advanced Placement Support (part recruiter firm, part work coach. Note that most are antiquated, stuck-in-the-1980s, cover-your-company’s-ass firms that are functionally worse than looking up jobs on LinkedIn and really should have been disrupted by now, but every so often you find a really great person)
- [ ] Submit all applicable expenses and timecards (most companies with reimbursements will allow some grace period for expenses, and if you are hourly/contractor make sure your timecard is up to date so you get paid out correctly)
- [ ] Write and share a LinkedIn post
  - [ ] In this day and age, sharing that you got laid off and are looking for positions in certain fields is one of the easiest ways to find another great job. You’d be surprised who will reach out and share amazing job opportunities once they know you’re on the market
- [ ] Decide if you want to sign the severance agreement (if offered)
  - [ ] It never hurts to negotiate severance, just know that the bigger the company (and the bigger the layoff), the more HR will use the “we used the same criteria for everyone” defense
  - [ ] Unless you think you have adequate grounds to sue, or critical mass to negotiate severance together, you’ll probably want to take the agreement
  - [ ] If you do think you have adequate grounds to sue, make sure you have documentation on everything, get a very good lawyer (potentially class-action depending on what’s going on), and do not sign
    - [ ] NOTE: threatening to sue feels good in the moment, but it is a lot of work (and potentially a lot of money spent on lawyers). When I say “adequate grounds to sue” I mean it
- [ ] Dust off that resume
  - [ ]If you don’t keep a list of accomplishments from your job, quickly write everything down you can think of while it’s fresh (you can reword and pare things down later)

# Other Tips
* Talk to people
  * It feels better to discuss layoffs in a group
  * It feels better to discuss what’s happening instead of bottling it up
* Move comms off company platforms
  * You are definitely being watched by IT/workplace if you weren’t already, so any planning, comparing layoff packages, etc. should be done on encrypted apps and other platforms off of your internal company platforms
*  Brainstorm your ABZ plan
  * Plan A (status quo) is now bust, you got laid off
  * Plan B: what were you working towards/hoping to go towards? Maybe the silver lining of the layoff is you can chase that now.
  * Plan Z: worst case scenario, everything crumbles, can’t find employment, what do you do? For some, that’s going back to live with parents. For others, this might be finding a local minimum-wage job after unemployment runs out and the job search is otherwise not fruitful. My sincere hope is your “Plan Z”, when you really think it through, is not as bad as you fear. And hey, you still have Plans B through Y to get through first.
* Keep up your health
  * Go outside every day (unless it’s literally unsafe to go outside)
  * Gently ramp up your exercise while you have more “free time” (walking, running, swimming, free weights, gym, group classes, whatever, just get moving)
  * Take time to sleep
  * Get a flu shot, get a covid shot
  * Continue with your primary care physician, or consider getting one – annual physicals are important for preventative health
    * Remember, your health insurance lasts through the entire month of your last date of employment (and you can elect COBRA as well)
* Continue with your therapist, or consider getting one – funny how we will readily get a checkup when something is physically hurting or broken, but we don’t always make the time when something hurts inside
* People respond differently to the stress of a layoff. If you find yourself gaining/losing weight rapidly, self-monitor for a week. If you lose 5+ pounds and continue losing weight after a week, check in with a doctor just in case. Same is true if you gained 5+ pounds without any change in diet.
